# vumi-go-data-tools

Praekelt Foundation does a lot of work using the Vumi Go messaging platform. 
Vumi Go makes all data captured available as CSV files but as of yet does not 
provide tools for doing pivot table based analysis on that data. The idea is 
to develop set of reusable tools that allows a developer to quickly do pivot 
tables on large CSV files that Vumi Go produces on behalf of the project owner 
for post campaign analysis. These tools should give insight into session counts, 
returning visitors and effectiveness of different approaches taken with differing 
Vumi Go contact groups that interact with a service.
